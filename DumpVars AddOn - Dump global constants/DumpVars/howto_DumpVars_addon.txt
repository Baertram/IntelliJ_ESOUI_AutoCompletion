1. Run the php script file   "global_vars.php"
A file named  "DumpVars_constants.lua" will be created
2. Copy the folder /DumpVars with all contents (DumpVars.txt, DumpVars.lua) to your addons folder live/Addons
-> Read here how to find the addons folder: https://www.esoui.com/forums/faq.php?faq=install#faq_howto_install
2. Put the created file "DumpVars_constants.lua" into the folder live/AddOns/DumpVars

/dumpvars
7. Watch the chat output.
Either an automatic ReloadUI will happen, or do a manual reloadui after chat ouput said it's finished.
8. Logout
9. Navigate to the live/SavedVariables folder and copy the file DumpVars.lua -> It's the file containing the dumped global
variables AND their values as table "Dumped constant name" = value now
e.g.
    ["Default"] =
    {
        ["@YourAccountName"] =
        {
            ["$AccountWide"] =
            {
                ["Settings"] =
                {
                    ["constants"] =
                    {
                        [1000xx APIVersion of the server you dumped the variables on] =
                        {
                            ["ADDITIONAL_INTERACT_INFO_EMPTY"] = "2",
                            ["CRAFTING_TYPE_JEWELRYCRAFTING"] = "7",
                            ["SOCIAL_RESULT_NO_GUILD_LEADER_RANK_DEFINED"] = "49",
                            ["LFG_ROLE_TANK"] = "2",
                            ["OPTIONS_CUSTOM_SETTING_SOCIAL_CHAT_COLOR_SAY"] = "7",
...
						}, --closing "1000xx APIVersion of the server you dumped the variables on"
					}, --closing "constants"
                }, --closing Settings
			},	--closing "$AccountWide"
        }, --closing "@YourAccountName"
    } --closing "Default"
10. Copy the contents of the table "1000xx APIVersion of the server you dumped the variables on", so just the variable with it's value like
                            ["ADDITIONAL_INTERACT_INFO_EMPTY"] = "2",
                            ["CRAFTING_TYPE_JEWELRYCRAFTING"] = "7",
                            ["SOCIAL_RESULT_NO_GUILD_LEADER_RANK_DEFINED"] = "49",
                            ["LFG_ROLE_TANK"] = "2",
                            ["OPTIONS_CUSTOM_SETTING_SOCIAL_CHAT_COLOR_SAY"] = "7",

to a new txt file e.g. "eso_api-globals.lua"
You need to remove the table structure around the savedvars data and just put constant = value into a lua file!
If you wish to you can split the contents of the DumpVars savedvards into 2 files so the ["sounds"] will get into an own file, e.g. "eso_api_sounds.lua".
Remove the [" and "] around the constant names (globals and sounds), and remove the , character at the line end!
You may sort the files afterwards online via e.g. https://www.online-utility.org/text/sort.jsp so the constants are sorted alphabetically!
